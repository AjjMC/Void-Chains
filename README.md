## Overview

Void Chains is a unique PvP minigame inspired by KOTH, Spleef, and other game modes. Two teams compete in an empty arena with Anchors and Bridges suspended over the void.

**A TEAM'S ANCHORS...**

* are generated upon game start.
* act as respawn points for the team.
* can be generated by the team on its Bridges.
* can be claimed by the other team.

**A TEAM'S BRIDGES...**

* can be formed from within the team's territory (Anchors and Bridges).
* collapse if they are not connected to any of the team's Anchors.
* override the other team's Bridges.

**A TEAM WITHOUT ANCHORS...**

* cannot respawn until an Anchor becomes available.
* loses if none of its players are able to play.

**THE POWERUP...**

* appears near the arena center.
* is activated by players holding it.
* gets destroyed if not collected on time.

**THE BORDER...**

* begins to shrink after some time.
* kills players and destroys Anchors.
* stops eventually, leaving enough space.
