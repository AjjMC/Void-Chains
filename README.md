Void Chains is a competitive PvP minigame that blends elements from various game modes, including KOTH and Spleef. In this high-stakes contest, two teams battle for domination on an ever-changing landscape suspended by chains over the void. By manipulating the battlefield through unique mechanics, the goal is to strategically claim all the respawn points of the enemy, ensuring their complete elimination and securing victory.

# Getting Started

* Join a team through your hotbar (unless randomly assigned)
* Select a kit through your hotbar compass (optional)
* Open the game menu by opening the "PLAY" barrel
  * Adjust the game settings (optional)
  * Start the game (a player is required on each team)

# Gameplay

* Two teams begin with a number of anchor platforms assigned to each, suspended at random locations over the void, which serve as respawn points
* Players can form land trails to expand their color and traverse the void, starting from one of their anchor platforms
* If part of a territory is not attached to any anchor platforms of the same color, it collapses
* Player trails can override the opposite color and detach enemy land from the anchor platforms supporting it, causing isolated blocks to fall and "spleef" others
* It is possible to walk into the opposing territory and not override it, but land cannot be expanded from within that color
* Players can claim anchor platforms of the enemy team, and new anchor platforms may be generated within a team's own territory
* The border will begin to shrink, destroying all anchor platforms it touches and limiting player movement
* The objective is to eliminate the opposing team after claiming all the anchor platforms and preventing enemy player respawning
