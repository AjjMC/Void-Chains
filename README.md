Void Chains is a competitive PvP minigame that blends elements from King of the Hill, Splatoon, and Spleef. In this high-stakes contest, two teams battle for domination on a constantly shifting landscape suspended by chains over the void. Players must harness their skills and collaborate effectively to manipulate the battlefield and trigger the collapse of the opposing team's territory. The ultimate goal is to strategically force the enemy into the abyss, ensuring their complete elimination and securing victory. Through innovative mechanics and teamwork, participants engage in intense, tactical gameplay where every move could be decisive.

## Getting Started

* Join a team through your hotbar (unless randomly assigned)
* Select a kit through your hotbar compass (optional)
* Open the game menu by opening the "PLAY" barrel
  * Adjust the game settings (optional)
  * Start the game (a player is required on each team)

## Gameplay

*	Two teams begin with a number of anchor platforms assigned to each, suspended at random locations over the void, which serve as respawn points

*	Players can form land trails to expand their color and traverse the void, starting from one of their anchor platforms

* If part of a territory is not attached to any anchor platforms of the same color, it collapses

*	Player trails can override the opposite color and detach enemy land from the anchor platforms supporting it, causing isolated blocks to fall and "spleef" others

*	It is possible to walk into the opposing territory and not override it, but land cannot be expanded from within that color

*	Players can claim anchor platforms of the enemy team, and new anchor platforms may be generated within a team's own territory

*	The border will begin to shrink, destroying all anchor platforms it touches and limiting player movement

*	The objective is to eliminate the opposing team after claiming all the anchor platforms and preventing enemy player respawning
